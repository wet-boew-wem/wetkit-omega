# WetKit Omega

WetKit Omega 4.x is a modern, [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) enabled Drupal 7 theme powered by the Omega base theme.

## Documentation

The [Omega 4.x documentation](https://drupal.org/node/1768686) is hosted on drupal.org as part of the handbook section. Please note that we are still in the process of writing the documentation. If you want to get involved, please contact us.

## Sub Theming

The easiest way to create a new WetKit Omega based sub-theme is by using [Drush](http://drupal.org/project/drush). Omega itself comes with a very easy-to-use Drush command for generating sub-themes through a command-line wizard. You can start the sub-theme creation wizard by invoking `drush omega-wizard` in the command-line and specifying you wish to create a subtheme of WetKit Omega.
